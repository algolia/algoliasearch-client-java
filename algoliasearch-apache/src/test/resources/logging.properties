# Properties file which configures the operation of the JDK logging facility.
# The system will look for this config file to be specified as a system property:
# -Djava.util.logging.config.file="path to logging.properties"

# Add handlers to the root logger.
# These are inherited by all other loggers.
handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# Set the logging level of the root logger.
# Levels from lowest to highest are
# FINEST, FINER, FINE, CONFIG, INFO, WARNING and SEVERE.
# The default level for all loggers and handlers is INFO.
.level=ALL

# Configure the ConsoleHandler.
# ConsoleHandler uses java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter by default.
# Even though the root logger has the same level as this,
# the next line is still needed because we're configuring a handler,
# not a logger, and handlers don't inherit properties from the root logger.
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=FINEST

# Specify logging levels for specific namespaces.
