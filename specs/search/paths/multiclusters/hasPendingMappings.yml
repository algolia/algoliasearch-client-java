    Get the status of your clusters' migrations or user creations.

    Creating a large batch of users or migrating your multi-cluster may take quite some time. This method lets you retrieve the status of the migration, so you can know when it's done.

    Upon success, the response is 200 OK.

    A successful response indicates that the operation has been taken into account, and the userIDs are directly usable.
